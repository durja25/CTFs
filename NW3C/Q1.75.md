I didnt know what Streebog256 or Shannon Scale was so i just loaded whole directory in cyberchef n searched for those thats how i found streebog.After looking through all the files i found same hash that shown in challenge.So now i started wondering what the hell is that Shannon scale was after some wondering i found something that gives us a scale and used entropy to scale that file and used the scale value as flag.
