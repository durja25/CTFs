we were given a hex 79 72 69 76 67 76 70 68 66 and we had to decrypt it.
at first i was confused abt it bc i relied too much on cyberchef(magic recipe) and didnt go for manual deciphering methods now i learned.

so after going through some staff i did go them and i found that it was rot13 
like that i got first flag.
