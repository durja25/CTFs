This was really tricky question if u dont know powershell for offensive security for that i looked through every powershell based thing out there then i found powersploit which was in there. Now that we know that we need to search that it got alot easier.

if u list all files we hv you will see that there is Mozilla hidden directory so searched around for stuff that is used for storing history n stuff
this artrical  was very using in solving this challenge it lists all useful databases that are avail in mozila and there uses.

Now that i know where to look we can open places.sqlite file in either sqlite3 or sqlitebrowser and select moz_places amd search for power we get the search history and copy last_visit_date now place that in cyberchef and decode it to unix timestamp.

Now convert that to format specified and submit it.
