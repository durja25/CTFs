we had something of android in the download folder so i started there just by using tree  found there was database file for calllog.db After opening that file in sqlite i searched for 95 duration call.

they said call was over tachyon i searched for that in that column name

```1601776417609```

using cyberchef i decoded that that and added the 95 duration for call and submitted that as flag.

BTW we have to use microsecond here for that recipe.

FYI: I spend hours on that to get correct format and to figure out that addition  part
